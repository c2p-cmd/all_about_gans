# All About GANS - learning playground

This repo is a tiny sandbox for learning GANs. Play, break things, learn from the mess.
I will explore both GANs and tranformer VAEs.

## What this is

- Experiments > production
- Notes, toy models, and goofy visualizations

## Goals

- Understand generator & discriminator basics
- Tweak losses, architectures, and hyperparams
- Produce something slightly less terrible every day

## Quickstart

1. Create a virtualenv: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`

Have fun. Save often. Curiosity required.
